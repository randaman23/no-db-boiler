The NODB project was given to us at the end of our first 2 weeks I believe. It was given to us to immitate data being retrieved from a database, without actually using one.

For mine I used a few different API's. I used dog.ceo and aws.random.cat with a random quote API as well. The quote one seems to not be usuable anymore.

The idea was to select a picture of a cat, dog, or both and a quote, and you had a small space to record your thoughts.

Pretty funny to see how I did things back when I first started. I can see I have come a long ways in a short period of time.
